# StarBuzz-DesignPatternDecorator
The Decorator design pattern dynamically assigns additional responsibilities to an object. It provides a flexible alternative to bypass, 
to extend functionality. It allows you to isolate the responsibilities of an object and it closes classes on modification and leaves them 
open for extension.
